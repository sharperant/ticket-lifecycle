<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>
<p>
<p>
INTAKE. A user named Ken initiates a support request by opening a new ticket through the osTicket system:

<p>
<p>
This marks the beginning of the ticket lifecycle and logs Ken’s issue into the help desk queue for review by support staff.

<p>
<p>
TICKET ASSIGNMENT. Once the ticket is submitted, a support agent John Doe, logs into the help desk dashboard to check for new and existing tickets requiring attention.
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
Upon reviewing the newly submitted ticket, Agent John begins the initial assessment of the issue and prepares to handle or delegate it accordingly.
<p>

<p>
<p>
COMMUNICATION. Upon examining the details of the ticket, Agent John determines that it is a Severity-A (Sev-A) emergency, which indicates a critical issue that requires immediate intervention.
<p>
<p>
Realizing that the issue is beyond his scope or requires specialized expertise, he decides to escalate the ticket by reassigning it to a System Administrator. Before transferring it, he ensures that proper internal notes and communication are added to maintain clarity for the next handler.
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
WORKING THE ISSUE. The reassigned ticket is received by System Administrator Jane Doe, who logs into her portal to take over the issue.
<p>
<p>
<img width="723" height="521" alt="slide6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd2d343a-30c1-47db-9f5b-6be98119cd03" />
<p>
<p>
Jane reviews all existing notes, investigates the root cause, applies the necessary fixes, and provides a detailed update within the system. After resolving the issue, she changes the status of the ticket from ‘Open’ to ‘Resolved’, ensuring it reflects its current state.
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
RESOLUTION. Back on his dashboard, Agent John observes that Jane has completed the task and left an update for him. He verifies the message and confirms the issue has been resolved to satisfaction. The ticket is now marked as closed in the system.
<p>
<p>
<img width="836" height="456" alt="slide8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/547a21bc-ebe0-4923-b408-b16ce5749155" />
<p>
<p>
This example illustrates a straightforward ticket lifecycle—from user submission to resolution—highlighting key interactions among support staff. It showcases how a ticket moves through stages of assignment, escalation, collaboration, and closure.

In real-world environments, however, the lifecycle of a ticket may involve more complex paths, such as:

Reassigning the ticket to different departments or tiers based on specialization

Escalating the severity level if the business impact increases

Routing the ticket to more experienced agents or teams as required

Such workflows ensure efficient and effective issue resolution aligned with organizational goals.

Support agents may handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets per day, depending on the size and demands of the company. A clear understanding of the ticket lifecycle enables better communication, faster resolutions, and improved customer satisfaction.
